# CeRVE: Multi-View Learning Framework for Predicting Unknown Types of Cancer Markers

CeRVE (Cancer Marker Prediction using Multi-View Learning and Directed Graph Neural Networks) is a multi-view learning framework designed to predict unknown types of cancer markers. This method combines multi-view learning with directed graph neural networks to enhance the accuracy of cancer marker prediction.

## Environment Dependencies

The implementation of CeRVE relies on the following environment:

- **Python**: 3.7
- **Numpy**: 1.21.5
- **Scikit-learn**: 1.2
- **Torch**: 1.10.2
- **Scipy**: 1.7.3

Please ensure that you have the above dependencies installed before running this project. You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.21.5 scikit-learn==1.2 torch==1.10.2 scipy==1.7.3
```

## Code Structure

CeRVE's code structure includes two main components: the Multi-View Learning Approach (MLF) and the Directed Signed Graph Neural Network (DGNN).

### 1. Multi-View Learning Approach (MLF)

The MLF component includes:
- **GUS Similarity Calculation**
- **Sigmoid Similarity Calculation**
- **Similarity Fusion**
- **Snake Convolution**

Ultimately, MLF integrates these processing steps to output a feature matrix for subsequent graph neural network processing.

**Implementation Reference**: `SimDSconv.py`

#### Data Input

Please refer to the data input example: `./data/sample-MLF`

### 2. Directed Signed Graph Neural Network for Fitting Regulatory Mechanisms (DGNN)

The DGNN component takes the feature matrix generated by MLF and a directed graph as input, aiming to fit regulatory mechanisms using graph neural networks, thereby enhancing the prediction capabilities for cancer markers.

**Implementation Reference**: `sdgnn.py`

#### Data Input

Please refer to the data input example: `./data/sample-DGNN`

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Data

First, ensure you have the data samples in the `./data/sample-MLF` and `./data/sample-DGNN` directories.

### 2. Run the Multi-View Learning Approach (MLF)

In the `SimDSconv.py` file, execute the MLF component with the following command:

```bash
python SimDSconv.py --data_path ./data/sample-MLF
```

### 3. Run the Directed Signed Graph Neural Network (DGNN)

In the `sdgnn.py` file, execute the DGNN component with the following command:

```bash
python sdhnn.py --feature_matrix_path <path_to_feature_matrix> --graph_path <path_to_graph>
```

Where `<path_to_feature_matrix>` is the path to the feature matrix output by MLF, and `<path_to_graph>` is the path to the directed graph file.

## Results

The generation and evaluation of results can be analyzed through the output files obtained from the above two steps. Specific results can be referred to in the `result` section of the project.
